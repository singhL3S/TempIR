\begin{hwproblem}

Use learning to rank to learn a new ranking function for the Temporalia task. Learn a ranking model for each temporal intent. Using the trained models compute the metrics -- precision and NDCG, for the queries provided. You can use 5-fold cross validation to report results.
\\ 
The main objectibve is to generate various features for query document pairs and use RankLib to learn a model for ranking. You can use the same set of features for each temporal intent but make sure you learn different models. You can also use features unique to each intent if you want. You will be evaluated on generating a ranking model that does at least marginally better than a language model. We will look the the features you implement and check if you were able to learn a ranking fucntion from the given data.
